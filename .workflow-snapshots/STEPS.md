# VaniScript Electron Migration Steps

**Source of Truth:** `docs_VANISCRIPT_APPLE_SILICON_TO_ELECTRON_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (§19 execution plan, §20 work packages) in the `VaniScript-Electron` repository.

## P0 — Baseline and characterization

**Goal:** Reproducible build/test baseline of the shipped Electron product before any structural migration work.

**Depends on:** none

**Do:**
- [x] [P0.D1] Baseline build/test inventory: build matrix and characterization suite

### Objective gates
- [x] [P0.O1] Clean CI on 3 OS

### Judgment gates
- [x] [P0.J1] Characterization suite captures real product behavior, not aspirational coverage

## P1 — Foundation

**Goal:** Shared contracts, typed IPC bridge, modular main process, sandboxed windows, and navigation stores as the stable base for all feature lanes.

**Depends on:** P0

**Do:**
- [x] [P1.D1] Shared schemas/errors/events in `shared/contracts`
- [x] [P1.D2] Typed preload/IPC facade: narrow versioned bridge
- [x] [P1.D3] Main module split: bootstrap/services/ipc/workers
- [x] [P1.D4] Sandboxed BrowserWindow with CSP policy handlers
- [x] [P1.D5] Route/projection stores: bounded feature mounting

### Objective gates
- [x] [P1.O1] Legacy media flows pass through the new bridge or legacy adapter
- [x] [P1.O2] Runtime validation, invalid payload/sender, security, and navigation perf tests pass

### Judgment gates
- [x] [P1.J1] Renderer cannot reach Node outside the typed bridge (no layer bypass)
- [x] [P1.J2] Sandbox/CSP cannot be silently weakened by feature code

## P2 — State/data/platform foundation

**Goal:** Durable settings/vault/storage, project v3 model with atomic store and bundles, capability registry, and provider/model catalogs — localStorage no longer a source of truth.

**Depends on:** P1

**Do:**
- [x] [P2.D1] Settings disk store: atomic JSON/migrations
- [x] [P2.D2] Credential vault: secret refs/adapters
- [x] [P2.D3] Legacy localStorage migration: one-shot handshake
- [x] [P2.D4] Settings UI parity: 9 sections + usage
- [x] [P2.D5] Project v3 model/migrator: media/document union
- [x] [P2.D6] Atomic project store: revisions/recovery
- [x] [P2.D7] Bundle import/export: manifest/checksums
- [x] [P2.D8] Platform capability registry: reason/remediation/backend
- [x] [P2.D9] Cloud provider catalog/router: Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic/Qwen/OpenRouter/Ollama/custom
- [x] [P2.D10] Local model manager: scan/download/verify/relocate

### Objective gates
- [x] [P2.O1] Restart, corrupt-store, migration, and archive tests pass
- [x] [P2.O2] Settings no longer depends on localStorage as source of truth

### Judgment gates
- [x] [P2.J1] No plaintext secrets at rest; vault refs only
- [x] [P2.J2] Project migrations recoverable; atomicity holds under crash/conflict

## P3A — Document lane

- [x] [P3A.O3] Editor mutation, undo, and stale-response tests pass

### Judgment gates
- [x] [P3A.J1] Source documents remain immutable; normalized state is derived

- [x] [P3A.J3] Malformed/hostile inputs fail safe without hangs or data loss

## P3B — Batch lane

### Objective gates
- [x] [P3B.O1] Migration/transaction and crash/restart recovery tests pass
- [x] [P3B.O2] 10k-row virtualization E2E passes

### Judgment gates
- [x] [P3B.J1] Symlink/case fuzz cannot escape path confinement
- [x] [P3B.J2] Companion `.txt` writes are collision-safe and receipted

## P3C — MCP/Agents lane

**Goal:** Loopback MCP runtime with auth/audit, read-then-mutation tool catalog, Codex/Grok/Qwen agent clients, and assistant UI integration.

### Objective gates
- [x] [P3C.O1] Network/auth and tool schema tests pass
